DNS ROLE

This role simply creates a master (primary) and a secondary (slave)
dns servers.

Here are a list of assumptions and prerequisites for this role:
1. You have already planned your DNS scheme and you know what you
   are doing.
2. You are configuring one master and one slave DNS servers, a total of two.
3. You are using a RedHat 7 based distribution.

Order in which you should build your DNS environment with this role.
1. Plan your DNS scheme.
2. First configure the master DNS server. This is necessary in order to
   generate the rndc key. The rndc key is what is used to securely communicate
   between the slave and master DNS servers.
3. Configure the slave DNS server.
